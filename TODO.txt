	Defense Changes:
		0- Change cart to combine a products quantity if they add the same product
		-Login for admin and useradmin should be in different pages and different database tables
			-Also remove role column and role checking in script
			-Edit structure of users table, add more for information like address and full name
		- admin & superadmin should see the orders from users
		- Doing anything in the admin and superadmin menu would require a password (Example: Deleting a user, adding a product, etc.) and would also record it in the database
		- Should also display log of the actions happening like who bought something, the order number, statistics, what they bought , and etc.
			0-Add log table for user,admin, & superadmin

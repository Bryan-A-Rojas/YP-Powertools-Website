	Defense Changes:
		- Change cart to combine a products quantity if they add the same product
		- admin & superadmin should see the orders from users
		- Doing anything in the admin and superadmin menu would require a password (Example: Deleting a user, adding a product, etc.) and would also record it in the database
		- Should also display log of the actions happening like who bought something, the order number, statistics, what they bought , and etc.
